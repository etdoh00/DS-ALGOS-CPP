# DS-ALGOS-CPP
This is an educational tool that has been shared on places like LinkedIn and Reddit.
I plan to cover:

--->Basic C++ code
---> Pointers and Dynamic allocation
---> Classes and Stack DS
---> Template Functions, Class and Stacks
---> Lists
---> Trees and Recursion
---> Complexity Analysis
---> Searching
---> Sorting

All code will be in C++, I will try my best to explain concepts through comments but any problems please message me.
I will also be creating mini exercises for you to try what you have learned.

The first sections will be basic and explain briefly the necessary syntax and tools from C++, then it will quikcly ramp up when I move onto the Data Structures and Algos.


Thanks for reading, etdoh.
